    <h1>Nevada Injury Claim Timeline (Las Vegas)</h1>
    <p class="lede">
      This page provides a general educational overview of common stages people research when learning about injury claims in Nevada.
      It is written for Las Vegas readers and is not legal advice.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Stage 1: Immediate Medical Care and Safety</h2>
    <p>
      Many people start by focusing on medical evaluation and safety. Even if injuries feel minor at first, people commonly research
      what symptoms to watch and how follow-up care is documented.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Stage 2: Documentation and Reporting</h2>
    <p>
      People often collect photos, contact information, report numbers, and written notes early. They may request official reports
      and keep a timeline of appointments and communications.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Stage 3: Insurance Notification and Claim Review</h2>
    <p>
      People commonly notify insurance carriers and obtain claim numbers. Insurance reviews can involve requests for documentation,
      recorded statements, and medical records (depending on the situation).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Stage 4: Ongoing Treatment and Records</h2>
    <p>
      When injuries require ongoing care, people often track appointments, symptoms, work restrictions, and expenses. Records can become
      important during later review and discussions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Stage 5: Resolution Discussions</h2>
    <p>
      Some situations involve discussions, negotiations, or formal processes. Because details vary widely, many people consult official
      sources and licensed professionals for guidance specific to their facts.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>A Note on Deadlines</h2>
    <p>
      Nevada has legal deadlines that can affect options. Because deadlines can depend on the facts, this site does not provide legal advice.
      If deadlines are a concern, people commonly consult official sources or a licensed professional.
