    <h2>Understanding Truck Accidents</h2>
    <p>
      Truck accidents often involve commercial vehicles such as delivery
      trucks, tractor-trailers, or other large freight vehicles. Due to their
      size and weight, these incidents may differ from standard passenger
      vehicle collisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a metropolitan area like Phoenix, truck traffic is common on major
      highways, industrial corridors, and distribution routes. Factors such
      as vehicle type, road conditions, and traffic patterns may influence
      how these accidents occur.
