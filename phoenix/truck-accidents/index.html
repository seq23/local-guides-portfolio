      <h2>About Truck Accidents in Phoenix</h2>
      <p>
        Truck accidents often involve larger vehicles and can result in more serious injuries.
        These crashes may include commercial trucks, delivery vehicles, or other large
        commercial carriers operating throughout the Phoenix area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many truck accidents in Phoenix occur on major routes such as I-10, I-17,
        and Loop 101, where commercial traffic is common.

      <h2>Why Truck Accidents Are Different</h2>
      <ul>

        <li>Multiple parties may be connected to the vehicle or driver</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
