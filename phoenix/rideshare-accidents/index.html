    <h2>Understanding Rideshare Accidents</h2>
    <p>
      Rideshare accidents may involve vehicles operating through app-based
      transportation platforms, including situations where a rideshare driver
      is transporting a passenger, en route to a pickup, or operating the
      vehicle independently.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Phoenix, rideshare services are commonly used for commuting, airport
      travel, and nightlife transportation. Traffic conditions, pickup and
      drop-off locations, and driver activity status can all influence how
      these incidents occur.
