  <section class="editorial-context">
    <h2>Phoenix-Specific Driving Context</h2>
    <p>
      Phoenix is a large metropolitan area with extensive freeway systems,
      high daily commuter volume, and frequent road construction. Car accidents
      in the region may involve a range of scenarios, including multi-vehicle
      collisions, highway incidents, and crashes occurring during peak traffic
      hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Local conditions such as road design, traffic density, and seasonal
      travel patterns can influence how collisions occur and what factors may
      be relevant when researching next steps.
