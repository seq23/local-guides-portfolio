    <h2>Understanding Car Accidents in Phoenix</h2>
    <p>
      Phoenix is a large metropolitan area with extensive freeway systems,
      high daily commuter traffic, and frequent road construction. Collisions
      may occur in a wide range of circumstances, including highway travel,
      surface streets, and residential areas.

      be relevant when researching next steps.
