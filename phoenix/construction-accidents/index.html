    <h2>Understanding Construction Accidents</h2>
    <p>
      Construction accidents may involve a wide range of activities and
      environments, including commercial developments, roadway projects,
      residential construction, and industrial sites. Incidents can involve
      equipment, machinery, falls, or interactions with vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Phoenix, ongoing growth and infrastructure development mean that
      construction activity is common throughout the metropolitan area.
      Conditions such as worksite layout, traffic proximity, and weather may
      influence how construction-related incidents occur.
