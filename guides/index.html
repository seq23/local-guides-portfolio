    <h1>Accident & Injury Guides</h1>
    <p>
      The guides on this site provide general, educational information about
      common accident scenarios, injury-related questions, and research topics.
      They are intended to help readers understand terminology, processes,
      and considerations — not to provide legal or medical advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every situation is different. Outcomes depend on many factors, and
      nothing on this site should be interpreted as professional guidance.
