    <h1>General Injury Claim Timeline</h1>
    <p class="lede">
      People researching injury claims often want to understand what the overall
      process may look like over time. While every situation is different, many
      injury claims follow a series of commonly researched stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guide provides a general, educational overview of the phases people
      often encounter when learning about injury claims. It is intended to help
      readers better understand terminology, sequence, and typical areas of focus —
      not to provide legal advice.

  <!-- STAGE 1 -->
  <section>
    <h2>1. The Incident and Initial Reporting</h2>
    <p>
      The timeline typically begins with an accident or incident that results in
      injury. At this stage, people often focus on immediate safety, medical
      attention, and documenting what occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Common research topics at this point include accident reports, incident
      documentation, and how information is preserved shortly after an event.
      The actions taken early on may affect how information is reviewed later.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- STAGE 2 -->
  <section>
    <h2>2. Medical Evaluation and Follow-Up Care</h2>
    <p>
      After the initial incident, many people undergo medical evaluation and,
      in some cases, ongoing treatment. This stage can involve follow-up visits,
      diagnostic testing, or physical therapy, depending on the nature of the
      injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      People often research how medical records are created, how treatment
      timelines vary, and why consistent documentation is commonly referenced
      in injury-related discussions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- STAGE 3 -->
  <section>
    <h2>3. Insurance Notification and Claim Submission</h2>
    <p>
      Another commonly researched stage involves notifying relevant insurance
      providers. This may include auto insurance, property insurance, or other
      applicable coverage depending on the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, people often look for information about claim forms,
      communications with insurers, and what information is typically requested
      during the review process.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- STAGE 4 -->
  <section>
    <h2>4. Information Review and Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      After a claim is submitted, information is usually reviewed. This stage
      may involve evaluating documentation, medical records, and incident details.
      The length of this phase can vary widely depending on complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      People researching this stage often want to understand why claims can take
      time, what factors may be reviewed, and how additional information requests
      sometimes arise.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- STAGE 5 -->
  <section>
    <h2>5. Resolution or Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      Many claims eventually reach some form of resolution. This may occur through
      settlement discussions, further review, or other processes depending on the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outcomes and timelines vary significantly. Because of this, individuals often
      consult licensed professionals or official resources for guidance specific to
      their circumstances.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WHAT THIS DOES NOT MEAN -->
  <section>
    <h2>Important Context</h2>
    <p>
      Not every injury claim follows the same timeline, and not every stage applies
      in every situation. Some claims resolve quickly, while others take longer due
      to complexity, documentation, or dispute.
    </p>

      guarantees, or advice.
