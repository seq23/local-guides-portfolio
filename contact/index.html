      <h2>About the Team Behind This Site</h2>
      <p>
        The Accident Guides is built and operated by Spry Labs, a division of Spry VSL, LLC.
        Since 2013, our team has worked across digital products, online platforms, and
        data-driven publishing initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our experience spans multiple sectors, including advertising technology,
        B2B software, early-stage technology companies, and capital markets–adjacent
        environments. Much of our work has focused on building systems that operate
        at scale, meet regulatory and compliance standards, and serve users during
        high-stress decision-making moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        This background informs how we approach clarity, structure, and trust in every
        educational property we operate.
