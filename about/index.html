  <h2>What We Are</h2>
  <p>
    The Accident Guides is an independent educational publishing platform that
    provides general information about accident types, recovery considerations,
    and commonly researched questions following injuries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our content is designed to help people understand topics they are already
    researching — not to replace professional legal or medical advice.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What We Are Not</h2>
  <p>
    We are not a law firm, medical provider, referral service, or lead broker.
    We do not sell leads, share personal data, or receive referral fees.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any directories or listings published on this site are informational only
    and based on publicly available information.
  </p>
</section>

  <h2>How the Platform Works</h2>
  <p>
    The platform is organized around two core layers:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Educational content</strong> — guides, timelines, and checklists
      that address common accident-related questions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Clearly labeled advertising</strong> — fixed placements that do
      not influence editorial content.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Editorial content is created independently. Advertising is always disclosed
    and never presented as a recommendation or endorsement.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>City-Based Coverage</h2>
  <p>
    The Accident Guides is built to expand city by city, providing location-specific
    educational context where appropriate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Phoenix, Arizona is currently live. Additional major U.S. cities are in
    development.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Advertising Transparency</h2>
  <p>
    Advertising placements are limited, fixed, and clearly labeled. We do not
    rotate ads or sell impressions.
  </p>
  <p>
    National advertisers may claim a <strong>site-wide buyout</strong>, which
    includes ownership of all available premium placements across the platform,
    including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Home page hero visual placement</li>
    <li>City index pages</li>
    <li>Category pages</li>
    <li>Editorial guide placements</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Site-wide placements are reserved for a single advertiser at a time and are
    clearly disclosed as advertising.
