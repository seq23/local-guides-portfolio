      <h1>About The Accident Guides</h1>
      <p>
        The Accident Guides is an educational publishing platform created to help people
        navigate the first steps after an accident or serious injury.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to reduce confusion during stressful moments by providing clear,
        plain-language information, practical checklists, and structured guides that help
        readers understand what to do next.

      <h2>Who Operates This Site</h2>
      <p>
        The Accident Guides is built and operated by Spry Labs, a division of Spry VSL, LLC.
        Since 2013, our team has worked across digital products, online platforms, and
        data-driven publishing initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our experience spans multiple sectors, including advertising technology,
        B2B software, early-stage technology companies, and capital markets–adjacent
        environments. Across these domains, we have focused on building systems that
        scale responsibly, operate within regulatory and compliance constraints, and
        prioritize clarity and user trust.

      <h2>How Our Background Informs This Project</h2>
      <p>
        Many of the platforms we have worked on required translating complex information
        into formats that are understandable, accessible, and actionable for non-expert
        audiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        That same approach guides The Accident Guides. We emphasize structure,
        neutral language, and clear separation between educational content and
        advertising, so readers can understand their options without pressure
        or confusion.
