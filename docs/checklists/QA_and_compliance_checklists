Good catch. Below are **TWO NEW, ENFORCEMENT-GRADE MARKDOWN CHECKLISTS** — **not sparse**, written to actually protect you. These **replace** any prior QA or compliance checklists.

### What to do next (clean + safe)

1. Save both files using the paths above
2. Delete / archive old QA + compliance checklists
3. Treat these as **hard gates** for Phoenix freeze and all future cities

If you want, next I can:

* Customize both for **Phoenix v1 specifically**, or
* Merge these into a **single “Pre-Deploy Gate” document** for VAs
